Description :

This is a client-server application designed for managing a medical laboratory. It provides different interfaces for various roles within the laboratory:

Manager (Gérant): Manages the stock, finances, and personnel.

Biologist (Biologiste): Handles samples, performs analyses, and inputs results into the system for doctors to review.

Receptionist (Réceptionniste): Registers patients, records their information, and manages the cash register.

Doctor (Médecin): Consults patient analyses and generates reports based on the results.

Each role has its own specific interface for efficient and organized management within the laboratory.

Note:

This application is my graduation project and is still under development. While it covers the core functionalities for managing a medical laboratory, some small details and additional features may be added in the future.
